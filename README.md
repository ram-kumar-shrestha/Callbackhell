# Callback Hell and Its Solutions

This repository explores the concept of callback hell in JavaScript/jQuery and provides alternative solutions to mitigate its drawbacks. Callback hell refers to the situation where nested callbacks are used extensively, leading to code that is hard to read, understand, and maintain. Asynchronous operations and their dependencies become deeply nested, resulting in a pyramid-shaped structure of callbacks.
